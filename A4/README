Our compiler is awesome.

We tested it using a variety of expression assignments, conditionals and while-loops.
We also tested using sample code provided from lecture notes. 

For the optimization if there are any consecutive loads/stores to the same address, we remove
the second line. NOTE: if the second line is a labelled line we do not remove this as that line 
needs to be executed when it is jumped to.

We do this optimization every combination of consecutive load/store (eg: load/load, load/store, etc)
	

to run:

	make view: views the python code
	make compile : runs the python code 
	
	make view-trans : views the symbolic code
	make view-link : views the linked code
	make view-op : views the optimized linked code
	
	make run : runs the non optimized code on the RAM simulator
	make run-op : runs the optimized code on the RAM simulator
	
	make clean : cleans the out files and the pyc files

	<optional> set RAM_MEM before invoking run target to specify memory size
