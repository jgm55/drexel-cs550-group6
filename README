To run our parser use the following makefile commands:

	make view-part1 : views all the python files associated with part 1
	make view-part2 : views all the python files associated with part 2 
	make build : sort of useless, since we are using python
	
	run-part1 : runs the parser for part 1
	run-part2 : runs the parser for part 1
	
	view-func1 : views the function for iterative list length written for our parser
	view-func2 : views the function for recursive list length written for our parser

	clean : cleans all the useless generated files

The return value for a function looks like : "return:=[stuff to return]"	
	
We tested part1 by using our listLength files along with testing cons, cdr, || and car extensively on our own 
	using both lists and variables in the function calls. We also did basic testing with the operators from the 
	given code to verify that the types worked properly (cannot do list+list, but can do number+number, etc)
	
	
Most of the development for Part1 was done on Windows, but was verified on Tux.cs.drexel.edu (when it wasn't down).
