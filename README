To run our parser use the following makefile commands:

	make view-part1 : views all the python files associated with part 1
	make view-part2 : views all the python files associated with part 2 
	make build : sort of useless, since we are using python
	
	run-part1 : runs the parser for part 1
	run-part2 : runs the parser for part 1
	
	view-func1 : views the function for iterative written for our parser
	view-func2 : views the function for recursive written for our parser

	clean : cleans all the useless generated files
