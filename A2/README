Overview
--------
To run our parser use the following makefile commands:

	make view-part1 : views all the python files associated with part 1
	make view-part2 : views all the python files associated with part 2
	make build : sort of useless, since we are using python
	
	run-part1 : runs the parser for part 1
	run-part2 : runs the parser for part 2
	
	view-func1 : views the mini language function for iterative list length
	view-func2 : views the mini language function for recursive list length

	clean : cleans all the generated files

The return value for a function looks like : "return:=[stuff to return]"

Part 1 Notes
------------
We tested part1 by using our listLength files along with testing cons, cdr,
|| and car extensively on our own using both lists and variables in the
function calls. The most complex sample input is included (sample_input.txt).
We also did basic testing with the operators from the given code to verify
that the types worked properly (cannot do list+list, but can do
number+number, etc)
	
Most of the development for Part1 was done on Windows, but was verified on
Tux.cs.drexel.edu (when it wasn't down).

------------
Part 2 Notes
------------
Part 2 was tested similarly to part 1, with the difference being that garbage
collection required a more complex sample input to invoke. The included
sample_input.txt will run successfully with a minimum memory size of 16.
Using a size of 16 or 17 will trigger garbage collection when creating list a.
When running part 2, the default memory size is 20. To change the default,
pass a size as the first argument to the interpreter. Change the MEMSIZE
variable in the makefile to change the memory size.

Part 2 was developed on MacOS 10.7 and was verified on Tux.cs.drexel.edu.
